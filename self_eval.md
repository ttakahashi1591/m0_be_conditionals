# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    - It is useful to use a `conditional` statement in your code when you are trying to compare one or more conditions to one or more variables. 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    - This assignment definitely was challenging, but I think could have just slowed down a little more. I noticed that many of my errors occured due to minor syntax mistakes. 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    - I think completing the Medium challenege which I called the `habanero_chili_challenge.rb` because it really took some trial and error around with the conditional statement to ensure that all factors were included. It was great to test run it in the Terminal and receive the expected results!
