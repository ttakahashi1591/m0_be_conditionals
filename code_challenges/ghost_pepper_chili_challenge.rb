=begin Write a Ruby program that prints out a String or Integer: The printed value will depend on the value 
of an Integer. If the Integer is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz". If the Integer is a multiple of 5, 
print "Buzz". If the Integer is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". 
If the Integer is not a multiple of either, print the Integer itself. =end
